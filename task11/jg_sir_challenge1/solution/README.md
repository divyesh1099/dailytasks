#### Jg told not to discuss solution among ourselves ,
- so I solved it and submitted it to sir, then he gave me some more hints and explanation, 
- then I shared it with my mentor and he also explained me more, 
- then I came up with my solution, then compared my solution with a colleague just for optimisisation and to get information that, what are the other ways to do it if any. 
- So the colleague's solution is that.
